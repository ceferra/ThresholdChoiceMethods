# ThresholdChoiceMethods With Uncertainty

In this repository you can find R code for testing different Threshold Choice Methods With  Context Uncertainty

The threshold choice methods are described in the paper:
["A unified view of performance metrics: translating threshold choice into expected classification loss"](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2503332)
J Hernández-Orallo, P Flach, C Ferri - The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2012

This software has been developed by Cèsar Ferri, José Hernández Orallo and Peter Flach.

* Generate areas for the threshold choice methods for a set of datasets and a certain level of uncerainty [experiments_binomial_v72](experiments_binomial_v72.R)
